# hello-world
This GitHub Repository is a gateway for helping me learn how to use GitHub.
Currently, I am following this tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
This tutorial so far is very helpful and I feel it will help me in the future.

What I learned in this tutorial: 
Created an open source repository
Started and managed a new branch
Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
Opened and merged a Pull Request
